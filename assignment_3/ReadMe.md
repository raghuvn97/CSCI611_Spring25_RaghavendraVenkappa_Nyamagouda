- Steps to Run the code
  - Download the entire code from Google Drive and open the ipynb file in the Jupyter Notebook.
  - Edit the device parameters based on the availability of GPU or CPU. Later, run the cells for each model training parameter.
- Trained YOLO Model: Provided in repository partial due to push restrictions. The entire code can be accessed with this Google Drive link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R9E1TX6_YySm6gR3o59tL8QMDHzV4VhK?usp=sharing
